/// <summary>
/// A script example that can be use for players' avatars in a game where the server is authoritative or non-authoritative.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// When using this example script, it should be added as a component to the game object that a player controls.
/// The game object must have a character controller component, not a rigidbody.
/// The observed property of the uLink.NetworkView for the game object should be set to this component.
///
/// Auth Server: The basic idea for this script is that the owner (controlling this object) sends unreliable "Move" RPCs to 
/// the auth server with a rate dictated by uLink.Network.sendRate. The auth server receives this RPC and moves the 
/// character. If you want to add security checks in the server because it should be authoritative, you can do that. Make a 
/// copy of the script and do your modifications.
///
/// Non-auth Server: The basic idea for this script is that the owner (controlling this object) sends statesync to the 
/// non-auth server with a rate dictated by uLink.Network.sendRate. The auth server receives this statesync and moves the 
/// character. 
///
/// Both auth server and non-auth server sends statesync to clients with proxies.
///
/// This script component also makes sure the movement is smooth in the server and in the clients showing the proxy objects.  
/// </remarks>
